# AOL-Exploratory-Analysis
The goal of this collection is to provide real query log data that is based on real users. It could be used for personalization, query reformulation or other types of research.

## QUESTIONS

### 1. EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS

interesting.
Targeted Audience
b. What do you want to share with the Product Manager of Search based on exploratory
analysis of this dataset ?
Mispelled Errors.
c. What are some common queries ?
Found Google and search engines
d. Which queries do not typically lead to a click ?
Mispelled and Vulgar searches
e. Which queries almost always lead to a click ?
Correctly spelled queries

Ranks 5 and up!
g. How long are typical time spent by users on the search engine ? What does this distribution
look like ?
h. What are the top urls that show up in results ?

### 2. CLUSTERING Can you identify clusters of users ? Points to ponder;

b. How will you cluster users ?
c. What features will you consider ?
d. How will you choose the right number of clusters ?
e. What distance metric will you choose ?
f. Please provide any writeups
in the Jupyter notebook itself using a text cell

### 3. CLASSIFICATION Predict likelihood of click at the user level. Points to ponder on;

a. Given a user’s activity, predict the likelihood of the user clicking on a search result.
b. Feature engineering is a big part of a data science role. You will need to identify/derive
additional features for this task.

d. Crossvalidation
is an important part of developing models. How will you crossvalidate
the
model ?
